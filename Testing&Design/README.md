# Testing & Design document


## Design Methodology

After completing my decision map I was able to think in depth about what the front end would require to enable the user to complete the required paths/operations.
I started by designing some Figma design frames for my Splash screen, Objective page & Interaction screen.

**I thought about 3 key statments when designing my frames which would be used for my front end:**
1. The application should be simple to use and easy to understand.
2. The application must be able to handle the back end and have the appropriate events handlers to make that possible.
3. The application should display all the information the user requires to make a informed choice on which path to take.

**I though about what type of colour pallet would be suited towards my application:**
* I decided on a blue and white colour pallet which would be visually appealing as it is soothing to the eyes, and fits the theme of milk, this is because:
    1. Milk is usually white.
    2. One of the most popular choices of milk is "Whole milk" which is usually represented with a blue accent coloured container by most brands.

### High-Quality Figma Frames

## Considerations
Unfortuantly you cant just import SVGs into android studio and have them interactive, they can only be imported as backgrounds non interactive.  This meant I was required to make more simplistic frames which could be imported and used as the backgrounds for my application Empty Activitys.
